Flasky
======

This is a starting point for Flask development based on Miguel Grinberg's [Flasky](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flasky) application. Note that the `requirements` listed are based directly on this code and are certainly not up-to-date (but are sufficient). You/we may well see the need to update some of these requirements.
